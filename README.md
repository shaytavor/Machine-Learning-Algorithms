# Machine Learning Algorithms
Iâ€™m using ml algorithms for quite a long time now, but always via libraries that already perform the hard algorithmic and mathematic work for me (such as PyTorch and sklearn). While it is a practical way for doing ml tasks, I've always wanted to understand the techniques behind all those algorithms. And I understand best when I code, so I decided to code the algorithms by myself, and hope to understand them well.

I invite you to read and follow, maybe you'll find it inspiring.
